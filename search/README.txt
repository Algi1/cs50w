Hello and welcome to my CS50W SEARCH PROJECT!

This project is a search engine that was created as part of the CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course offered by Harvard University. The goal of this project was to develop a search engine that would allow users to search for a specific keyword or phrase and return relevant results.

To use this search engine, simply type in your search query in the search bar and hit the search button. The results will be displayed on the page and you can scroll through the different pages to see more results.

One of the key features of this search engine is its ability to rank results based on relevance. This means that the results that are most likely to be what you are looking for will be displayed at the top of the page.

Another great feature of this search engine is its ability to filter results by date, relevance, and type (e.g. images, videos, etc.). This allows you to find exactly what you are looking for, even if you are searching for something very specific.

To make sure that the search results are up-to-date, this search engine uses a web crawling system to continuously update its database. This means that the results you receive are always the most current and relevant.

I hope you find this search engine to be a valuable tool in your search for information. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me!

Thank you for using my CS50W SEARCH PROJECT!
